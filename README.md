# MovementTestTask
The goal of the task was to create a movement script for an object going at a steady speed
from one point to the other and instantiate 100 randomly placed objects, when colliding with the randomly 
placed objects the moving objects should explode and play a sound and a particle and when it reaches the 
finish point it should also explode and destroy itself.
